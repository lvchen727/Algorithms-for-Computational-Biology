# Algorithms-for-Computational-Biology

####### This course is a survey of algorithms and mathematical methods in biological sequence analysis (with a strong emphasis on probabilistic methods) and systems biology. Sequence analysis topics include introduction to probability, probabilistic inference in missing data problems, hidden Markov models (HMMs), profile HMMs, sequence alignment, and identification of transcription-factor binding sites. Systems biology topics include discovery of gene regulatory networks, quantitative modeling of gene regulatory networks, synthetic biology, and (in some years) quantitative modeling of metabolism.
